-Simple Blockchain
A blockchain implementation that handles basic transactions and utilizes smart contracts. The project is built using Python for the backend and Ganache for blockchain simulation. Transaction requests are processed using Flask and Postman. The consensus protocol is implemented to ensure the integrity of the blockchain. Additionally, a smart contract written in Solidity is utilized to interact with the blockchain. The project also includes ICO processing and relevant tests.

-Overview
Welcome to Simple Blockchain, a project that demonstrates the core concepts of a blockchain system.
It showcases the implementation of basic transactions, a consensus protocol, and smart contract integration. 
With the help of Python, Flask, Postman, Solidity, and Ganache, this project provides a practical understanding of blockchain technology and its application in a decentralized environment.

-Features
Basic transaction handling within the blockchain.
Consensus protocol to ensure the validity of the blockchain.
Utilization of a smart contract written in Solidity.
Processing of ICO (Initial Coin Offering) within the blockchain.
Implementation of tests to verify the functionality of the blockchain.

-Installation
Follow these steps to install and set up the blockchain project:
Clone this repository or download the source code.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

-Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

-Start Ganache or any compatible blockchain simulator.
Configure the project to connect to the blockchain simulator by updating the necessary settings in the configuration file.
Run the application using the following command:
python main.py

-Usage
To interact with the blockchain and perform various operations, such as creating transactions, validating blocks, and executing smart contracts, follow these steps:
Use Postman or any HTTP client to send requests to the blockchain API endpoints.
Refer to the API documentation provided in the project to understand the available endpoints and their required parameters.
Send requests to the respective endpoints using the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
Monitor the blockchain's response and observe the changes in the blockchain's state.

-Smart Contract
The project utilizes a smart contract written in Solidity. 
The smart contract is responsible for handling interactions with the blockchain and executing predefined operations. 
It is designed to ensure transparency and security within the blockchain ecosystem. 
Refer to the smart_contract.sol file in the project for the Solidity code.

-Tests
The project includes a set of tests to verify the functionality and integrity of the blockchain. 
These tests cover various scenarios and use cases to ensure that the blockchain performs as expected. To run the tests, execute the following command:
python test.py
